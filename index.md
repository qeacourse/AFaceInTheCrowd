    excerpt: "
    The Bridge of Doom challenge involves programming the robot to successfully drive over a harrowing bridge.  The bridge is made less harrowing since students have a parametric equation defining its shape.  Students learn about robot kinematics, curves and motion, and using distance sensors to correct for errors.

## <a name="course-philosophy"/> QEA in a Nutshell

Quantitative Engineering Analysis (QEA) is an interdisciplinary, integrated, course for students to become proficient in learning new technical content and successfully completing projects that have a significant analytical component to them.  This video summarizes some of the rationale and specific pedagogy behind the course.
