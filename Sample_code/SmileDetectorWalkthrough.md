This is a walkthrough that is linked from the [Day 6 page](/Chapters/M1_Day6.pdf).  Students are invited to build their own implementation based on the intuition developed previously in the day document, but some students may want a more scaffolded experience. Additionally, some students may use this walkthrough as a way to check their implementations or learn some new programming and algorithmic skills.

Note: [smiles.mat](/Data/smiles.mat) is the dataset used in this example.
