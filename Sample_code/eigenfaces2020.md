This is a sample solution of implementing the Eigenfaces algorithm for facial recognition on a dataset of images collected of the QEA students.  The students do this exercise as part of their [Night 7 assignment](/Chapters/m1_night7.pdf).  This code can be used in conjunction with [makeAccuracyPlot](makeAccuracyPlot).
