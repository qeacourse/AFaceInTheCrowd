This is an example of an application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that the students engage with in the [Day 8 page](/Chapters/M1_Day8.pdf).  The exercise is intended to solidify their theoretical understanding of the SVD through a relatable, fun application..

Note: [movielens25m.mat](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y-7bHwfN9dXKKpOVfVQqd4oViNpXXytD) is the dataset used in this example.
