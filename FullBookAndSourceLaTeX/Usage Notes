Some notes about using this Overleaf realization of the QEA "book"

1. The main file that controls the overall book is "QEA1Spring2020.tex". 

2. Each assignment is a chapter in the overall book. They are contained within individual folders in the project. You can see these folders to the left. Each chapter is a .tex files, for example "FacesDay1.tex". 

3. Each chapter must be added to the book using an \include{foldername/filename} in the "QEA1Spring2020.tex" file. For example, \include{FacesDay1/FacesDay1}.

4. You can select to compile only certain chapters using \includeonly{foldername/filename}. For example, \include{FacesDay1/FacesDay1}

5. You can select between compiling in landscape or portrait. In the preamble of "QEA1Spring2020.tex", choose either "qeastructure.tex" for landscape, or "qeastructure_book.tex" for portrait.

6. You can toggle the solutions on or off by commenting \newcommand{\showsolutions} in "QEA1Spring2020.tex". 

7. Within a chapter, you can create an exercise using: 

\begin{prob}
 exercise text
\end{prob}

8. Similarly, you can create a solution using:

\begin{sol}
 solution text
\end{sol}

9. To generate a list of learning objectives that are set off in a box do the following:

\begin{learningobjectives}
\emph{Concepts}
\bi
\item State learning objective for concepts...
\ei
\emph{MATLAB skills}
\bi
\item State objective for skills...
\ei
\end{learningobjectives}

10. From John Geddes, 
I’ve include the “todonotes” environment so make it easier to keep track of what we need to do and where it is.

The syntax is as follows:
\todo[inline]{John needs a haircut before classes start}
and you place this as close to the location that needs changing as possible.

I’ve also include the “todolist” in the pre-chapter - it shows you which page it is on, and you can click on it and be taken directly to that point.


***** Most of the documents we copy over from previous years will need editing to account for the new exercise and solution environments********

Ongoing list of tips as I remember them:

a. The "newthought" command does not work. Using \paragraph is an ok substitute

2. If you want to place a figure inside a \prob{} or \sol{} environment, use a float like this:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.5 in]{FacesDay1/figs/ConceptBreakdown.pdf}
\captionof{figure}{If you were trying to break down special relativity, a \emph{portion} of your breakdown might look like this...}
\end{center}
